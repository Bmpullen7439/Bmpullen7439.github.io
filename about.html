      My name is Brian Pullen and I currently live in Naples, Florida.  I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.  I hope to use what I learn in the software engineering program to help me create my own functional business in the future.  I am not sure what exactly I want to do, but I do know that everything is based in the software world.  I hope to gain the fundamentals of software engineering that will help me to understand more complex topics.  I love being out on the water fishing and sailing, so I would be interested in joining the sailing club on campus.  If I was in the UFC, my get-hyped song would be Invincible by Skillet.  My favorite treat is chocolate brownies. 
      A few things I enjoy doing are:
