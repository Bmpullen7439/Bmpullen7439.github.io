        <h2>About Me:</h2>
      
        Introduction:
        My name is Brian Pullen and I currently live in Naples, Florida.  I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.  I hope to use what I learn in the software engineering program to help me create my own functional business in the future.  I am not sure what exactly I want to do, but I do know that everything is based in the software world.  I hope to gain the fundamentals of software engineering that will help me to understand more complex topics.  I love being out on the water fishing and sailing, so I would be interested in joining the sailing club on campus.  If I was in the UFC, my get-hyped song would be Invincible by Skillet.  My favorite treat is chocolate brownies. <br>
        
        Grit and Growth Mindset:
        I earned a grit score of 2 out of 5.  I can definitely do better seeing the kinds of things that define someone as having grit, and after watching the TED talk video.  I found it interesting in the TED talk video that Angela was talking about the difference between her students.  She mentioned that IQ was not the biggest difference between her highest achieving and lowest achieving students.  She also mentioned that IQ was the easiest thing to measure.  She wondered about why some students would succeed and others would not and this drove her to pursue a graduate degree in psychology to understand these reasons better.  
        She explained that despite all other factors included, grit was the most important factor in determining student success.  She says this applies to more than school, but also to jobs, careers, and other aspects of people’s lives.  It is interesting because, even though she says grit is the most important factor in determining someone’s success, there is very little research done to show how some people have more grit and others have less.  
        She explains that grit has to do with someone’s ability to make long term goals and to follow through with them.  It has to do with not giving up when faced with failure and difficulty.  She explains that having a growth mindset is one of the most important things a person can have if they want to have more grit.  This is because people who have a fixed mindset will give up quickly when faced with failure.  This is like math students who believe that people are either born a math genius or they are born unable to do math.  Someone with a growth mindset will be grittier than someone who has a fixed mindset because instead of letting setbacks and failures stop them, they use them as opportunities for growth.  
        Likewise, after seeing the video, I know that I must try harder to not let little setbacks and failures stop me from progressing.  I know it won’t be just one easy step, but a long process for me, although I plan to bring my grit score up from a 2 to a 5 so that I can succeed at everything I do.
        I can definitely relate to having had a fixed mindset in the past when I went to college for the first time.  My dad wanted me to go to college for something that I wasn’t interested in.  At the time, I did not feel engaged in the classes and I told myself, “This is not what I want to do.  College is not right for me.”  Because of the fixed mindset I had, I ended up dropping out of college and working for a few years.  When I look back on it though, I realize that I should have instead said something like, “This degree isn’t the right one for me, but I can find something that I will like and that I will do well in.”  I am trying my best to stick with the growth mindset and to know that small failures and discouragements won’t stop me from progressing in life and achieving what I want.
